## Website: [Display Location](https://geolaurajaimes.github.io/repo_ljaimesa/ex2displaytrack.html)
## Objective: AArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript Tutorials: Display your track
## Taken from [ArcGIS JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started/)
## Date Created: 9 - 11 February 2024
## Status: Broken

### Description
The website initially worked showing the location and a counter time for recording the movement of the device note: the device movement was not texted because the workstation is heavy. 
However, on February 12, 2024, the website stopped functioning correctly, and the following errors were observed in the console:

- [esri.widgets.Locate] üõë DEPRECATED - Property: useHeadingEnabled
  üõ†Ô∏è Replacement: rotationEnabled
  ‚öôÔ∏è Version: 4.27

- Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
- [esri.Basemap] #load() Failed to load basemap (title: 'Basemap', id: '18d8acdbdab-basemap-0')

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to [Display Location](https://geolaurajaimes.github.io/repo_ljaimesa/ex2displaylocation.html)
2. Observe the errors in the browser console.

### Expected Behavior
The website should display the location and a counter of time on a map.

### Actual Behavior
The website is not displaying the basemap, and the console shows multiple errors related to deprecated properties and failed resource loading.

### Additional Information
- This issue started occurring on February 12, 2024, after previously working as expected.
- The error messages indicate issues with deprecated properties and failed resource loading due to permission errors (status 403).
- The ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript version 4.27 is mentioned as the replacement for the deprecated property.
